<h4>Synopsis</h4>

<p>
The Juxta family of software (Juxta, Juxta WS, and Juxta Commons) allows you to
compare and collate versions of the same textual work. The Juxta Web
Service (Juxta WS) is an open source Java application that provides the core collation and
visualization functions of Juxta in a server environment via an API. Development
of Juxta WS was supported by NINES at the University of Virginia.
</p>

<h4>Features</h4>

<p>Juxta WS can collate two or more versions of the same textual work ("witnesses")
and generate a list of alignments as well as two different styles of
visualization suitable for display on the web. The "heat map" visualization shows a base text
with ranges of difference from the other witnesses highlighted. The
"side by side" visualization shows two of the witnesses in synchronously scrolling
columns, with areas of difference highlighted.

<h4>Collation Pipeline Overview</h4>

<p>The Juxta WS collation process is based on the Gothenburg Model, which breaks
collation in this pipeline of steps:</p>

<ol>
   <li>Raw Content is added to the system and becomes a "source" (XML and TXT are
    the accepted formats).</li>
   
   <li>The source is transformed into a "witness," with XML sources being
      transformed by XSLT and TXT sources passed through with limited metadata added.</li>
   
   <li>Witness are passed through a tokenizer that breaks text content into tokens
    based on whitespace and/or punctuation settings. Those tokens are stored in
    the database as offset / length pairs.</li>
   
   <li>Streams of witness tokens are then fed into the diff component, which finds
    areas of change. This diff is done with java-diff-utils from Google, and is an
    implementation of the Myers diff algorithm.</li>
   
   <li>These differences are aligned in a process by which gaps are
      inserted into the token stream such that the tokens of all witnesses match up. 
      These gaps fill in holes in the token stream where one witness has missing 
      content relative to another (for more information and examples, see the
      TEI wiki on Textual Variance). Once they are aligned, tokens that have been 
      found to have differences are paired, and this information is stored in the database.</li>
    
   <li>Visualizations leverage the alignment information to inject markup into
    witness texts. When passed up to a web browser, this marked-up
    text is rendered according to the selected visualization.</li>
</ol>
