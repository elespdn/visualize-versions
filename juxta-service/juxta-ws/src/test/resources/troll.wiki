A '''troll''' is a supernatural being in [[Norse mythology]] and [[Scandinavian folklore]]. In origin, ''troll'' may have been a negative synonym for a ''[[jötunn]]'' (plural ''jötnar''), a being in Norse mythology. In [[Old Norse]] sources, beings described as trolls dwell in isolated rocks, mountains, or caves, live together in small family units, and are rarely helpful to human beings.
