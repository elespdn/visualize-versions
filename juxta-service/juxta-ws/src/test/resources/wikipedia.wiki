==History==
Tea consumption has its legendary origins in China of more than 4,000 years ago.<ref>[http://inventors.about.com/od/tstartinventions/ss/tea.htm About.com. ''The History of Tea - Tea Bags and Makers]</ref> Green tea has been used as both a beverage and a method of traditional medicine in most of Asia, including China, Japan, Korea,  Thailand, and Vietnam, to help everything from controlling bleeding and helping heal wounds to regulating body temperature, blood sugar and promoting digestion.
A book written in the Tang Dynasty of China is considered one of the most important in the history of green tea. The book was written by [[Lu Yu]] and is called the "Tea Classic" or "Cha Jing". It was written between 600 and 900 AD and spoke about exactly how and where one could enjoy a fine cup of green tea.<ref>[http://www.green-teas-guide.com/history-of-green-tea.html ''The History of Tea]</ref>
The ''Kissa Yojoki'' (''Book of Tea''), written by [[Zen]] priest [[Eisai]] in 1191, describes how drinking green tea can have a positive effect on the five vital organs, especially the [[heart]]. The book discusses tea's medicinal qualities, which include easing the effects of [[alcohol]], acting as a [[stimulant]], curing blotchiness, quenching thirst, eliminating indigestion, curing [[beriberi|beriberi disease]], preventing [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], and improving [[urinary]] and [[brain]] function. Part One also explains the shapes of tea plants, tea flowers, and tea leaves, and covers how to grow tea plants and process tea leaves. In Part Two, the book discusses the specific dosage and method required for individual physical ailments.

== Growing, harvesting and processing ==
Green tea is processed and grown in a variety of ways, depending on the type of green tea desired. As a result of these methods, maximum amounts of [[polyphenol]]s and [[antioxidant]]s are retained, giving maximum green tea benefits. The growing conditions can be broken down into two basic types - those grown in the sun and those grown under the shade. The green tea plants are grown in rows that are pruned to produce shoots in a regular manner, and are generally harvested three times per year. The first flush takes place in late April to early May. The second harvest usually takes place from June through July, and the third picking takes place in late July to early August. Sometimes, there will also be a fourth harvest. It is the first flush in the spring which brings the best quality leaves, with higher prices to match.
Processed green teas, known as "aracha" are stored under low humidity refrigeration in 30 or 60&nbsp;kg paper bags at 0-5°C (32-41°F). This aracha has yet to be refined at this stage, with a final firing taking place before [[Tea blending and additives|blending]], selection, and packaging takes place. The leaves in this state will be re-fired throughout the year as they are needed, giving the green teas a longer shelf life and better flavor. The first flush tea of May will readily store in this fashion until the next year's harvest. After this re-drying process, each crude tea will be sifted and graded according to size. Finally, each lot will be blended according to the blend order by the tasters and packed for sale.<ref>[http://www.o-cha.com/green-tea-processing.htm ''Green Tea Processing]</ref>

==Brewing and serving==
[[Image:Tea leaves steeping in a zhong čaj 05.jpg|thumb|Green tea leaves steeping in a [[gaiwan]]]]
[[Steeping]] is the process of making a cup of tea; it is also referred to as [[brewing]]. In general, two grams of tea per 100ml of water, or about one teaspoon of green tea per five ounce cup, should be used.  With very high-quality teas like [[gyokuro]], more than this amount of leaf is used, and the leaf is steeped multiple times for short durations.

Green tea steeping time and temperature varies with  different tea.  The hottest steeping temperatures are 81°C to 87°C (180°F to 190°F) water and the longest steeping times two to three minutes.  The coolest brewing temperatures are 61°C to 69°C (140°F to 160°F) and the shortest times about 30 seconds.  In general, lower-quality green teas are steeped hotter and longer, while higher-quality teas are steeped cooler and shorter. Steeping green tea too hot or too long will result in a bitter, astringent brew, regardless of the initial quality. It is thought that excessively hot water results in [[tannins in tea|tannin]] chemical release, which is especially problematic in green teas, as they have higher contents of these. High-quality green teas can be and usually are steeped multiple times; two or three steepings is typical. The steeping technique also plays a very important role in avoiding the tea developing an overcooked taste. The container in which the tea is steeped or teapot should also be warmed beforehand so that the tea does not immediately cool down. It is common practice for tea leaf to be left in the cup or pot and for hot water to be added as the tea is drunk until the flavor degrades.

===Japanese green tea===
[[Image:Sencha.jpg|thumb|Japanese green tea]]
[[Image:Genmaicha.jpg|thumb|''Genmaicha'']]
{{nihongo|Green tea|緑茶|Ryokucha}} is ubiquitous in [[Japan]] and therefore is more commonly known simply as {{nihongo|"tea"|お茶|ocha}}. It is even referred to as {{nihongo|"Japanese tea"|日本茶|nihoncha}} though it was first used in China during the [[Song Dynasty]], and brought to Japan by [[Myōan Eisai]], a Japanese Buddhist priest who also introduced the [[Rinzai]] school of [[Zen]] Buddhism.
Types of tea are commonly graded depending on the quality and the parts of the plant used as well as how they are processed.<ref>{{cite book|title=The story of tea: a cultural history and drinking guide|first1=Mary Lou |last1=Heiss|first2=Robert J.|last2=Heiss|url=http://books.google.com/?id=3NBtM5aAAGgC&pg=PA179#v=onepage&q=|pages=179–185|year=2007|publisher=Ten Speed Press|isbn=1-58008-745-0}}</ref> There are large variations in both price and quality within these broad categories, and there are many specialty green teas that fall outside this spectrum. The best Japanese green tea is said to be that from the {{nihongo|[[Yame]]|八女|yame}} region of [[Fukuoka Prefecture]] and the [[Uji]] region of [[Kyoto]]{{Citation needed|guerrilla marketing|date=December 2010}}. [[Shizuoka Prefecture]] produces 40% of raw tea leaf.

*{{nihongo||玉露| '''[[Gyokuro]]'''|Jade Dew}}
:''Gyokuro'' is a fine and expensive type that differs from ''Sencha'' (煎茶) in that it is grown under the shade rather than the full sun for approximately 20 days.<ref>[http://www.ippodo-tea.co.jp/en/tea/gyokuro_03.html Illustrated explanation of the process for producing gyokuro tea]</ref> The name "Gyokuro" translates as "jade dew" and refers to the pale green color of the infusion. The shading causes the amino acids ([[Theanine]]) and caffeine in the tea leaves to increase, while [[tea catechins|catechins]] (the source of bitterness in tea, along with caffeine) decreases, giving rise to a sweet taste.<ref>[http://www.ippodo-tea.co.jp/en/tea/gyokuro_02.html About the effects of the shading process, and the components of this tea compared to others]</ref> The tea also has a distinct aroma.

*{{nihongo||冠茶|'''[[Kabusecha tea|Kabusecha]]'''|covered tea}}
: ''Kabusecha'' is made from the leaves grown in the shade prior to harvest, although not for as long as ''Gyokuro''. It has a more delicate flavor than ''Sencha''. It is sometimes marketed as Gyokuro.

*{{nihongo||煎茶|'''[[Sencha]]'''| decocted tea}}
: The first and second flush of green tea made from leaves that are exposed directly to sunlight. This is the most common green tea in Japan. The name describes the method for preparing the beverage.

:* {{nihongo||深蒸し茶| '''Fukamushicha'''|long-steamed green tea}}
:: Sencha, which, in the processing of the leaves, has been steamed two times longer than usual Sencha, giving it a deeper color and producing a fuller flavor in the beverage.

*{{nihongo||玉緑茶| '''[[Tamaryokucha]]'''|lit. ball green tea}}
: ''Tamaryokucha'' has a tangy, berry-like taste, with a long almondy aftertaste and a deep aroma with tones of citrus, grass, and berries. It is also called ''Guricha''.

*{{nihongo||番茶|'''[[Bancha]]'''|coarse tea}}
: Lower grade of ''[[Sencha]]'' harvested as a third- or fourth-flush tea between summer and autumn. ''Aki-Bancha'' (autumn Bancha) is not made from entire leaves, but from the trimmed unnecessary twigs of the tea plant.

*{{nihongo||窯煎茶| '''[[Kamairicha tea|Kamairicha]]'''|pan-fired tea}}
: ''Kamairicha'' is a pan-fired green tea that does not undergo the usual steam treatments of Japanese tea and does not have the characteristic bitter taste of most Japanese tea.

* By-product of Sencha or Gyokuro

:*{{nihongo||くき茶| '''[[Kukicha tea|Kukicha]]'''|stalk tea}}
:: A tea made from stems, stalks, and twigs. ''Kukicha'' has a mildly nutty, and slightly creamy sweet flavor.

:*{{nihongo||芽茶| '''[[Mecha tea|Mecha]]'''|buds and tips tea}}
:: ''Mecha'' is green tea derived from a collection of leaf buds and tips of the early crops. ''Mecha'' is harvested in spring and made as rolled leaf teas that are graded somewhere between ''Gyokuro'' and ''Sencha'' in quality.

:*{{nihongo||粉茶| '''[[Konacha tea|Konacha]]'''|(coarse) powdered tea}}
:: ''Konacha'' is the dust and smallest parts after processing ''Gyokuro'' or ''Sencha''. It is cheaper than ''Sencha'' and usually served at [[Sushi]] restaurants. It is also marketed as {{nihongo||玉露粉| ''[[Gyokuroko]]'' }} or ''[[Gyokurokocha]]''.

* Other

:*{{nihongo||抹茶| '''[[Matcha]]'''|powdered tea}}
:: A fine ground tea made from ''Tencha''. It has a very similar cultivation process as ''Gyokuro''. It is expensive and is used primarily in the [[Japanese tea ceremony]]. ''Matcha'' is also a popular [[green tea ice cream|flavor of ice cream]] and other sweets in Japan.

:*{{nihongo||玄米茶|'''[[Genmaicha]]'''|brown rice tea}}
:: ''Bancha'' (sometimes ''Sencha'') and roasted ''genmai'' ([[brown rice]]) blend.  It is often mixed with a small amount of ''Matcha'' to make the color better.

:*{{nihongo||ほうじ茶| '''[[Hojicha|Hōjicha]]'''|roasted tea}}
:: A green tea roasted over [[charcoal]] (usually ''Bancha'').

:*{{nihongo|| 碾茶|'''Tencha'''|milling tea}}
:: Half-finished products used for ''Matcha'' production. The name indicates its intended eventual milling into matcha. Because, like [[gyokuro]], it is cultivated in shade, it has a sweet aroma. In its processing, it is not rolled during drying, and tencha therefore remains spread out like the original fresh leaf.

:*{{nihongo||荒茶| '''[[Aracha]]'''|raw green tea}}
:: Half-finished products used for ''Sencha'' and ''Gyokuro'' production. It contains all parts of the tea plant.

:*{{nihongo||新茶|'''[[Shincha]]'''|a new tea}}
:: First flush tea. The name is used for either ''Sencha'' or ''Gyokuro''.

:*{{nihongo||粉末茶| '''funmatsucha'''|instant powdered tea}}
:: Milled green tea, used just like instant coffee.　Another name for this recent style of tea is ''"tokeru ocha,"'' or "tea that melts."

Green tea contains [[wikt:salubrious|salubrious]] [[polyphenols in tea|polyphenol]]s, in particular [[Tea catechins|catechins]], the most abundant of which is [[epigallocatechin gallate]] (EGCG). Green tea also contains carotenoids, [[tocopherol]]s, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), minerals such as chromium, manganese, selenium or zinc, and certain [[phytochemical]] compounds. It is a more potent antioxidant than [[black tea]],<ref name=BeneficialEffects2006/> although black tea has substances that green tea does not such as [[theaflavin]].

''[[In vitro]]'', animal, preliminary observational, and clinical human studies suggest that green tea can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, dental cavities, kidney stones, and cancer, while improving bone density and cognitive function. However, the human studies are inconsistent.<ref name=BeneficialEffects2006>{{cite journal |author=Cabrera C, Artacho R, Giménez R |title=Beneficial effects of green tea--a review |journal=J Am Coll Nutr |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=79–99 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16582024 |doi= |url=http://www.jacn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16582024}}</ref>

Green tea consumption is associated with reduced heart disease in epidemiological studies. One study has shown that it can reduce total and "bad" ([[LDL]]) cholesterol by decreasing cholesterol absorption in the gut.<ref name=reuters20120228>{{cite news|last=Norton|first=Amy|title=Green tea may trim "bad" cholesterol: study|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/17/us-tea-idUSTRE7AG0BD20111117|publisher=Reuters Health|accessdate=28 February 2012|date=2011-11-17}}</ref>  However, several other small, brief human trials found that tea consumption did not reduce cholesterol in humans.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} In 2003 a randomized clinical trial found that a green tea extract with added theaflavin from black tea reduced cholesterol.<ref name=2003RCT>{{cite journal |author=Maron DJ, Lu GP, Cai NS, ''et al.'' |title=Cholesterol-lowering effect of a theaflavin-enriched green tea extract: a randomized controlled trial |journal=Arch.

A study performed at the [[University of Birmingham]] showed that average fat oxidation rates were 17% higher after ingestion of green tea extract than after ingestion of a placebo.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/abstract/87/3/778 |title=Green tea extract ingestion, fat oxidation, and glucose tolerance in healthy humans|author=Venables, Michelle C |journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |year=2008 |month=March |author1=Venables, Michelle C| author2=Hulston, Carl J|author3=Cox, Hannah R|author4=Jeukendrup, Asker E |author4-link=Asker Jeukendrup |work=| volume = 87| issue =  3|pages=778–784 |accessdate=2008-10-25|pmid=18326618}}</ref> Likewise, the contribution of fat oxidation to total energy expenditure was also significantly higher by a similar percentage following ingestion of green tea extract. This implies that ingestion of green tea extract can not only increase fat oxidation during moderately intensive exercise but also improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in healthy young men.

A  study performed at the [[Queen Margaret University]], [[Edinburgh]] looked at the effects of short-term green tea consumption on a group of students between the ages of 19–37.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Emad Al-Dujaili, Jon-Paul Bradley, Suzana Almoosawi & Lorna Fyfe |title=Effects of green tea consumption on blood pressure, total cholesterol, body weight and fat in healthy volunteers |journal=Endocrine Abstracts |volume=20 |pages=P470 |year=2009 |url=http://www.endocrine-abstracts.org/ea/0020/ea0020P470.htm}}</ref> Participants were asked not to alter their diet and to drink 4 cups of green tea per day for 14 days. The results showed that short-term consumption of commercial green tea reduces systolic and diastolic [[Blood Pressure]], fasting total cholesterol, body fat and body weight. These results suggest a role for green tea in decreasing established potential cardiovascular risk factors. This study also suggests that reductions may be more pronounced in the overweight population where a significant proportion are obese and have a high risk of cardiovascular disease.

In a study performed at the Israel Institute of Technology, it was shown that the main antioxidant polyphenol of green tea extract, [[epigallocatechin gallate|EGCG]], when fed to mice induced with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, helped to protect brain cells from dying, as well as 'rescuing' already damaged neurons in the brain, a phenomenon called neurorescue or neurorestoration. The findings of the study, led by Dr. Silvia Mandell, were presented at the Fourth International Scientific Symposium on Tea and Human Health in Washington D.C., in 2007. Resulting tests underway in China, under the auspices of the [[The Michael J. Fox Foundation|Michael J.

This activity probably contributes to the antimicrobial activity of green tea extract and may be responsible for the effectiveness of green tea in oral hygiene.

According to research reported at the Sixth International Conference on Frontiers in Cancer Prevention, sponsored by the American Association for Cancer Research, a standardized green tea polyphenol preparation ([[Polyphenon]] E) limits the growth of colorectal tumors in rats treated with a substance that causes the cancer. "Our findings show that rats fed a diet containing Polyphenon E are less than half as likely to develop colon cancer," Dr. Hang Xiao, from the Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy at [[Rutgers University]], noted in a statement.

A study published in the September 13, 2006 issue of the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] concluded "Green tea consumption is associated with reduced mortality due to all causes and due to cardiovascular disease but not with reduced mortality due to cancer." The study, conducted by the [[Tohoku University]] School of Public Policy in Japan, followed 40,530 Japanese adults, ages 40–79, with no history of [[stroke]], coronary heart disease, or cancer at baseline beginning in 1994. The study followed all participants for up to 11 years for death from all causes and for up to 7 years for death from a specific cause. Participants who consumed 5 or more cups of tea per day had a 16 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality and a 26 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease ("CVD") than participants who consumed less than one cup of tea per day. The study also states, "If green tea does protect humans against CVD or cancer, it is expected that consumption of this beverage would substantially contribute to the prolonging of life expectancy, given that CVD and cancer are the two leading causes of death worldwide."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kuriyama S, Shimazu T, Ohmori K, ''et al.'' |title=Green tea consumption and mortality due to cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all causes in Japan: the Ohsaki study |journal=JAMA |volume=296 |issue=10 |pages=1255–65 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16968850 |doi=10.1001/jama.296.10.1255 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16968850}}</ref>

In May 2006, researchers at [[Yale School of Medicine|Yale University School of Medicine]] weighed in on the issue with a review article that looked at more than 100 studies on the health benefits of green tea. They pointed to what they called an "Asian paradox," which refers to lower rates of heart disease and cancer in Asia despite high rates of [[cigarette]] smoking. They theorized that the 1.2 liters of green tea that is consumed by many Asians each day provides high levels of [[polyphenols in tea|polyphenol]]s and other [[antioxidant]]s. These compounds may work in several ways to improve cardiovascular health, including preventing blood platelets from sticking together (this [[anticoagulant]] effect is the reason doctors warn surgical patients to avoid green tea prior to procedures that rely on a patient's clotting ability) and improving cholesterol levels, said the researchers, whose study appeared in the May issue of the ''Journal of the American College of Surgeons''. Specifically, green tea may prevent the oxidation of [[LDL cholesterol]] (the "bad" type), which, in turn, can reduce the buildup of plaque in arteries, the researchers wrote.<ref>[http://www.yale.edu/opa/newsr/06-06-01-01.all.html Green Tea and the “Asian Paradox”<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

A study published in the August 22, 2006 edition of Biological Psychology looked at the modification of the stress response via [[L-Theanine]], a chemical found in green tea.  It "suggested that the oral intake of L-Theanine could cause anti-stress effects via the inhibition of cortical neuron excitation."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kimura K, Ozeki M, Juneja LR, Ohira H |title=L-Theanine reduces psychological and physiological stress responses |journal=Biol Psychol |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=39–45 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=16930802 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2006.06.006 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0301-0511(06)00145-1}}</ref>

In a [[double-blind]], randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted by Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center]], Nashville, Tennessee; 240 adults were given either theaflavin-enriched green tea extract in form of 375&nbsp;mg capsule daily or a placebo. After 12 weeks, patients in the tea extract group had significantly less low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol (16.4% and 11.3% lower than baseline, p<0.01) than the placebo group. The author concluded that theaflavin-enriched green tea extract can be used together with other dietary approaches to reduce LDL-C.

A study published in the January, 2005 edition of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition concluded "Daily consumption of tea containing 690 mg catechins for 12 wk reduced body fat, which suggests that the ingestion of catechins might be useful in the prevention and improvement of lifestyle-related diseases, mainly obesity." <ref>{{cite journal |author=Nagao T, Komine Y, Soga S, ''et al.'' |title=Ingestion of a tea rich in catechins leads to a reduction in body fat and malondialdehyde-modified LDL in men |journal=Am.

According to a [[Case Western Reserve University]] School of Medicine study published in the April 13, 2005 issue of the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]], antioxidants in green tea may prevent and reduce the severity of rheumatoid arthritis. The study examined the effects of green tea polyphenols on collagen-induced arthritis in mice, which is similar to rheumatoid arthritis in humans. In each of three different study groups, the mice given the green tea polyphenols were significantly less likely to develop arthritis. Of the 18 mice that received the green tea, only eight (44 percent) developed arthritis. Among the 18 mice that did not receive the green tea, all but one (94 percent) developed arthritis. In addition, researchers noted that the eight arthritic mice that received the green tea polyphenols developed less severe forms of arthritis.

A German study found that an extract of green tea and hot water (filtered), applied externally to the skin for 10 minutes, three times a day could help people with skin damaged from radiation therapy (after 16–22 days).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/12/04/earlyshow/contributors/emilysenay/main2224186.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Studies: Green Tea May Help Prolong Life | date=December 4, 2006}}</ref>

A study published in the December 1999 American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that "Green tea has thermogenic properties and promotes fat oxidation beyond that explained by its caffeine content per se.

In lab tests, [[Epigallocatechin gallate|EGCG]], found in green tea, was found to prevent [[Human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]] from attacking T-Cells. However, it is not yet known if this has any effect on humans.<ref>[http://www.webmd.com/content/article/122/114877.htm Green Tea Blocks HIV in Test Tubes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

A study in the August, 2003 issue of a new potential application of Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences found that "a new potential application of (–)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate [a component of green tea] in prevention or treatment of inflammatory processes is suggested" <ref>{{cite journal |author=Rodríguez-Caso C, Rodríguez-Agudo D, Sánchez-Jiménez F, Medina MA |title=Green tea epigallocatechin-3-gallate is an inhibitor of mammalian histidine decarboxylase |journal=Cell.

A more frequent consumption of green tea was associated with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms in a Japanese study.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/abstract/90/6/1615|title=Green tea consumption is associated with depressive symptoms in the elderly|journal=Am J Clin Nutr.|volume=90 |pages=1615–22 |year=2009 |doi=10.3945/ajcn.2009.28216
|author=Kaijun Niu et al|pmid=19828710|issue=6}}</ref> Researchers conducted a cross-sectional study in 1,058 community-dwelling elderly Japanese individuals 70 years of age. The prevalence of mild and severe depressive symptoms was 34.1 percent and 20.2 percent, respectively. After adjustment for confounding factors, the odds ratios for mild and severe depressive symptoms when higher green tea consumption was compared with green tea consumption of 1 cup/d were: 2 to 3 cups green tea/d and 4 cups green tea/d. Similar relations were also observed in the case of severe depressive symptoms.

A 2004 study found that components of green tea (catechins) were effective against the parasite [[Trypanosoma cruzi]], which causes [[Chagas' disease]], a major disease in South and Central America.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Anti-Trypanosoma cruzi Activity of Green Tea (Camellia sinensis) Catechins|journal=Antimicrob Agents Chemother|doi=10.1128/AAC.48.1.69-74.2004|volume=48|pages=69–74|author=Cristina Paveto, María C.

The article ''Tea: A Story of Serendipity''<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/FDAC/features/296_tea.html Tea: A Story of Serendipity<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> appeared in the March 1996 issue of the United States [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] Consumer Magazine and looked at the potential benefits of green tea.  At that time the FDA had not done any reviews of the potential benefits of green tea and was waiting to do so until health claims were filed. The FDA has since denied two petitions to make qualified health claims as to the health benefits of green tea.<ref>[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=38989 Qualified health claim definition - Medical Dictionary definitions of popular medical terms easily defined on MedTerms<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On June 30, 2005, in response to "Green Tea and Reduced Risk of Cancer Health Claim", the FDA stated:
"FDA concludes that there is no credible evidence to support qualified health claims for green tea consumption and a reduced risk of gastric, lung, colon/rectal, esophageal, pancreatic, ovarian, and combined cancers.  Thus, the FDA is denying these claims.  However, the FDA concludes that there is very limited credible evidence for qualified health claims specifically for green tea and breast cancer and for green tea and prostate cancer, provided that the qualified claims are appropriately worded so as to not mislead consumers."<ref>[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/qhc-gtea.html US FDA/CFSAN — Letter Responding to Health Claim Petition dated January 27, 2004: Green Tea and Reduced Risk of Cancer Health Claim (Docket number 2004Q-0083)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

=== Possible drug interactions ===
A 2009 study at the [[University of Southern California]] using mouse models showed that several of the polyphenolic ingredients of green tea, such as [[epigallocatechin gallate|EGCG]], can bind with the anticancer drug [[bortezomib]], significantly reducing its bioavailability and thereby rendering it therapeutically useless.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Green tea polyphenols block the anticancer effects of bortezomib and other boronic acid-based proteasome inhibitors|journal=Blood |volume=113|pages=5927–5937|year=2009|doi= 10.1182/blood-2008-07-171389|author=Golden, E. |pmid=19190249|last2=Lam|first2=PY|last3=Kardosh|first3=A|last4=Gaffney|first4=KJ|last5=Cadenas|first5=E|last6=Louie|first6=SG|last7=Petasis|first7=NA|last8=Chen|first8=TC|last9=Schönthal|first9=AH|issue=23}}</ref> This chemical reaction between EGCG and bortezomib is highly specific and depends on the presence of a [[boronic acid]] functional group in the bortezomib molecule. Dr. Schönthal, who headed the study, suggests that consumption of green tea, concentrated green tea extract, and other green tea products (such as EGCG capsules) be strongly contraindicated for patients undergoing bortezomib treatment.<ref>{{cite web  | last = Neith  | first = Katie  | title = Green tea blocks benefits of cancer drug, study finds  | url=http://www.usc.edu/uscnews/stories/16226.html  | accessdate = 2009-02-04 }}</ref>
